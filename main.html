                            <p>
                                Hey there! I'm Ryu Pascua, an 18-year-old college student at Gordon College, and I'm all about the exciting world of computer science. Computers have been my thing since I was a kid, sparking my curiosity and leading me to pursue a degree in computer science to chase my dreams. Specifically, I'm aiming to become a programmer and game developerâ€”how cool would that be?
                            </p>
                            <p class="p2">When I'm not in class, you can probably find me in a Valorant match, navigating the digital challenges and enjoying the strategic thrills of the game. But it's not all about the virtual world for me; I love the real-world action too, especially when I'm on the volleyball court. Spiking and serving are not just moves in a game; they're my way of expressing the precision and coordination that I find fascinating in the coding world.  
                            </p>
                            <p class="p3">
                                Speaking of coding, I spend a good chunk of my time studying and experimenting with it. There's something incredibly satisfying about taking a problem, breaking it down, and turning it into functional code. Gordon College is like my playground, providing me with the tools and knowledge to shape my dreams into reality.
                            </p>
                            <p class="p4">
                                So, here I am, navigating the ins and outs of computer science, not just to acquire skills, but to pave the way for a future where my childhood fascination with computers becomes a rewarding career as a programmer and game developer. The journey is exciting, and I'm ready for every bit of it!

                        <h1>Goal</h1>
                        <p>My ultimate goal is to secure a well-paying job before turning 22, alongside opening a bank account to smartly save up for the future. With dreams of becoming a web, game developer and programmer, I'm committed to studying hard and honing my skills. The path might be challenging, but I'm determined to put in the effort to turn my aspirations into reality. By focusing on both academic pursuits and skill development, I aim to not just meet but exceed my goals, setting the stage for a fulfilling career and financial stability.</p>
